# Privacy Policy for YouTube Twitch Chat Toggle

**Last updated: August 14, 2025**

## Overview

YouTube Twitch Chat Toggle ("the extension", "we", "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

### What We DON'T Collect

-   **Personal Information**: We do not collect names, emails, or any identifying information
-   **Browsing History**: We do not track which websites you visit
-   **Usage Analytics**: We do not send usage statistics to any servers
-   **Direct Cookie Usage**: The extension itself does not set, read, or use cookies
-   **External Communications**: The extension does not communicate with external servers beyond embedding Twitch chat. Your settings are managed through Chrome's sync storage system.

### What We DO Store

-   **YouTube Channel Names**: Only the names of YouTube channels you associate with Twitch channels
-   **Twitch Channel Names**: Only the Twitch channel names you specify for associations
-   **Chat Preferences**: Your preference for which chat to display (YouTube or Twitch) per channel
-   **Extension Settings**: Configuration data needed for the extension to function

## Data Storage

The extension provides you with storage options:

-   **Default (Local Storage)**: Settings are stored locally in your browser only
-   **Sync Storage (Optional)**: When enabled, settings sync across your Chrome browsers via Google's infrastructure
-   **User Control**: You can toggle between local and sync storage in the extension popup
-   **Data Migration**: When switching storage types, your existing settings are automatically copied
-   **No Third-Party Servers**: We do not send data to our own servers or other third-party services

## Data Usage

The stored data is used exclusively to:

-   Remember which Twitch channels are associated with YouTube channels
-   Remember your chat display preferences
-   Provide a seamless user experience across browser sessions

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties:

-   We don't collect personal information beyond what's needed for functionality
-   We do not send data to our own servers or external analytics services
-   When sync is enabled, your settings are handled by Chrome's sync system (governed by Google's privacy policy)
-   When sync is disabled, your settings remain local to your device only

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts with external services:

-   **YouTube**: We read page content to detect channel names (no data sent to YouTube)
-   **Twitch Chat Embeds**: We embed Twitch chat iframes which are served directly by Twitch
    -   **Twitch's cookies**: Twitch uses their own cookies for authentication and functionality
    -   **Twitch's privacy policy**: Applies to all interactions within the embedded chat
    -   **User authentication**: Handled entirely by Twitch's systems
    -   **Extension access**: We do not access or read Twitch's cookies or user data

**Important**: When you interact with embedded Twitch chat, you are interacting directly with Twitch's service. Their privacy policy and data practices apply to those interactions.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

-   **View Settings**: All settings are visible in the extension popup
-   **Delete Data**: Remove the extension to delete all stored data
-   **Modify Settings**: Change or remove channel associations at any time

## Data Security

Your data is protected by:

-   Chrome's built-in storage security mechanisms
-   Chrome sync encryption (when syncing across devices)
-   No direct network transmission by our extension
-   No external database or third-party server storage by us

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
